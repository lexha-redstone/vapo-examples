"Everyone in the media is missing the point about Trudeau's Khadr debacle. Trudeau's actions are totally political. By not litigating further he is burying the mistreatment of Khadr perpetrated by the Liberal under Chretien/Martin. Trudeau settled now in hopes that voters would have short memories and forget about all this long before the next election. If Trudeau fought the law suit and lost, just before the next election, he would blame the courts to get political cover. However, litigation would inevitably reveal the misdeeds to the Chretien/Martin era.

Text: Everyone in the media is missing the point about Trudeau's Khadr debacle. Trudeau's actions are totally political. By not litigating further he is burying the mistreatment of Khadr perpetrated by the Liberal under Chretien/Martin. Trudeau settled now in hopes that voters would have short memories and forget about all this long before the next election. If Trudeau fought the law suit and lost, just before the next election, he would blame the courts to get political cover. However, litigation would inevitably reveal the misdeeds to the Chretien/Martin era. In an election, the Conservatives pummel the Liberals on Chretien/Martin complicity and would tell Trudeau to use the notwithstanding clause to overrule the courts, and avoid paying Khadr.

Text: Job, the guy who's usually described as patient, isn't patient at all.  He's complaining all the time and demanding that God tell him why the bad things have happened to him.  God answers him by telling Job that he doesn't know what he's talking about and can't.  God asks if Job created the winds and the stars and the mountains.  The implication is that Job (and the rest of us) can't understand why we're here and why we're suffering.  In other words, we struggle for answers but won't find any.  At least, though, we're alive.

Hoopili station is a bottleneck and many thousands of W Oahu commuters will have to all wait to ride feeder buses or fight to find parking to park and ride to the station and they all have to simultaneously queue up to board a single train at a time.  Also for safety each train has to be spaced far enough apart and that would be about when the train in front reaches the next station which is one mile away.  Since most W Oahu commuters either work or go to school at UH or all of the neighboring private schools in the Makiki/Manoa area or work in Waikiki, the feeder buses to these locations will be simularly overtaxed as well AND be caught in rush hour traffic like all other commuters who use their personal vehicles.  With 100% certainty the Oahu train project will be a total money pit failure.

Text: ** Medicaid will now return to what it was, *pre ACA. A safety net, temporary, not a Health Care Insurance plan."" 

Cutting Medicaid is delusional. We have an aging population, many of whom have no savings to cover long-term care. What do you suggest we do with these people? Let them live under a bridge. The GOP plan is to take the money away from the people who need it most and give it to those who need it least. If it passes, and I don't think it will, retribution will be brutal come 2018. Count on it.

Text: After reading some of your comments here I'd just like to say that it sounds like your parents were no picnic.  Neither were mine. My takeaway from your comments is that it takes two to create a nasty relationship like the one LW1 is describing and the parent has explained it in her letter in such a way as to suggest ""omg, I have noooooo idea why this wonderful child is speaking to me this way"".  Meanwhile, is the parent really that innocent? Probably not as innocent as the letter suggests.

"John, I agree with your post about the population crisis but our deserts are in fact getting greener due to CO2 fertilization.

CSIRO research shows the CO2 fertilization effect occurs where elevated CO2 enables a leaf during photosynthesis to extract more carbon from the air or lose less water to the air, or both. 

Essentially, plants in the desert are using far less of the limited water the area receives and are slowly encroaching in deserts like the Sahara and in Australia where the research was conducted.

Text: Thanks Paul. Interesting thought, that I'm partisan. I didn't used to be. I grew up mistrusting the establishment in general, and that included both political parties. I still mistrust career politicians, in general; but the issues themselves; and the behavior of the president and the party that defends him; have made me way more concerned than ever before. I fear the relentless attack on the credibility of the mainstream media and (the attack on) even the principle of freedom of the press. And I hate prejudice and bigotry. It's very sad that sticking to the principles of decency and liberty and justice for all make me appear partisan. That's the country we live in now.

Text: What an incredible stretch. An offer to meet is nothing of value, and no information was even shared.

Nevermind that Jr was not employed by the campaign in any way.

THEN now it's coming out that the lawyer was meeting privately with McCain and other Democrats (haha) and Obama's DOJ made an exception for her to enter the country after some problem with her visa.

So it's looking like the whole thing was an Obama/DNC/RINO set up to begin with. Which is hilarious.

To me, all of us, bikers, drivers and pedestrians need to be careful on these country roads (or anyplace else for that matter) watching out for others as well as oneself.
Your advice "" I walk along our country road...always facing traffic. As cars approach I and my dog always go to the shoulder and wait for traffic to pass "" is excellent, and as you note, most drivers are careful of pedestrians.

"I'd be interested to see how that would work in reality. How do they test for the time where a big dude resists arrest or when someone needs help two  blocks away and a full on sprint is required or one of a million other scenarios. The reason a basic test like this is used (military does it in a similar fashion), is that it's impossible to have a test for everything that is required. Basic fitness means that at least there is a baseline expectancy for what an officer can do.

How do they test for the time where a big dude resists arrest or when someone needs help two  blocks away and a full on sprint is required or one of a million other scenarios.
