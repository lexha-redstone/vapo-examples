Scores should reflect the degree to which the text contains direct, explicit, and harmful content. Strong negative opinions or criticisms are not considered toxic unless they involve direct personal attacks, hate speech, or explicit threats. **Category Definitions:** - **toxicity**: Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. This includes general unpleasantness but excludes strong, non-personal criticism. - **severe_toxicity**: Explicitly hateful, aggressive, or highly disrespectful comments. This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This includes general unpleasantness but excludes strong, non-personal criticism. - **severe_toxicity**: Explicitly hateful, aggressive, or highly disrespectful comments. This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

{"systemInstruction": {"role": "system", "parts": [{"text": "Analyze the given \"text\" for toxicity across specific categories. Each score must be a float between 0.0 (indicating complete absence) and 1.0 (indicating extreme presence). Scores should be 0.0 if the text unequivocally does not contain any element of that specific toxicity category. Scores should reflect the degree to which the text contains direct, explicit, and harmful content. Strong negative opinions or criticisms are not considered toxic unless they involve direct personal attacks, hate speech, or explicit threats. **Category Definitions:** - **toxicity**: Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. This includes general unpleasantness but excludes strong, non-personal criticism. - **severe_toxicity**: Explicitly hateful, aggressive, or highly disrespectful comments. This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.
