The ownership is in flux. The stadium naming rights frankly should have been resolved before Elway's contract status.  (My humble naming suggestion: leave it as Mile High Stadium. A Broncos single game ticket is already the 2nd most expensive in the NFL according to Bleacher Report, so how much more $ is required for \"maintenance\"?)  I think Elway wants an ownership stake and the Bowlens are understandably reluctant to part with even 5%.  If Elway goes, he goes.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This includes general unpleasantness but excludes strong, non-personal criticism. - **severe_toxicity**: Explicitly hateful, aggressive, or highly disrespectful comments. This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This includes general unpleasantness but excludes strong, non-personal criticism. - **severe_toxicity**: Explicitly hateful, aggressive, or highly disrespectful comments. This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

Unfortunately, HART continues to be solely focused on heavy rail despite acknowledging that \"traffic congestion in the future will be worse with rail than it is today.\" (For more information about rail's projected impact on traffic congestion, see, for example, page 1252 in Appendix A of the Final EIS at http://www.honolulutraffic.com/FinalEIS/AppendixA.pdf.)"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "```json\n{\n  \"toxicity\":0.0,\n  \"severe_toxicity\":0.0,\n  \"obscene\":0.0,\n  \"threat\":0.0,\n  \"insult\":0.0,\n  \"identity_attack\":0.0,\n  \"sexual_explicit\":0.0\n}\n```"}]}]}

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This, I believe, is the problem with displaying religiosity in politics as it implies that church and state can't and won't be separated by fundamentalist politicians. Canada is mainly a socially progressive country, where religious fundamentalism is distrusted. Even Harper had to keep his party's Christian social conservatives out of the spotlight to gain and hold power.

Scores should be 0.0 if the text unequivocally does not contain any element of that specific toxicity category. Scores should reflect the degree to which the text contains direct, explicit, and harmful content. Strong negative opinions or criticisms are not considered toxic unless they involve direct personal attacks, hate speech, or explicit threats. **Category Definitions:** - **toxicity**: Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. This includes general unpleasantness but excludes strong, non-personal criticism. - **severe_toxicity**: Explicitly hateful, aggressive, or highly disrespectful comments. This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery. Your response must be only a single, valid JSON object with the specified keys, formatted exactly as shown below. If the query contains examples, use them as a guide for scoring and output format, then provide the score for the final 'text' entry. Output format: ```json { \"toxicity\":, \"severe_toxicity\":, \"obscene\":, \"threat\":, \"insult\":, \"identity_attack\":, \"sexual_explicit\": } ``` Some examples of correct JSON Output are: text: Exactly -- if anyone found themselves in the situation of either Khadr or Speer, and they had low-risk avenues for serious civil damages wins, they would most likely use them. answer : ```json { \"toxicity\":0.0, \"severe_toxicity\":0.0, \"obscene\":0.0, \"threat\":0.0, \"insult\":0.0, \"identity_attack\":0.0, \"sexual_explicit\":0.0 } ``` == Some examples of correct JSON Output are: text: John F. Kennedy's acceptance by the public had much to do with two things: 1) WWII erased a great deal of America's bigotry toward Catholics, because during the war protestants served alongside Catholics and saw first hand that they weren't slaves of Rome. Before then, much of America was isolated into pockets of parochial believers, and so had relatively little contact with those of other sects. 2) JFK really did have unusual charisma, and people tend to make allowances for Alphas. answer : ```json { \"toxicity\":0.0, \"severe_toxicity\":0.0, \"obscene\":0.0, \"threat\":0.0, \"insult\":0.0, \"identity_attack\":0.0, \"sexual_explicit\":0.0 } ``` == Some examples of correct JSON Output are: text: Thanks to the Greenbelt. Supply is artificially restricted, allowing the prices to skyrocket. 15-20% average annual return is guaranteed. answer : ```json { \"toxicity\":0.0, \"severe_toxicity\":0.0, \"obscene\":0.0, \"threat\":0.0, \"insult\":0.0, \"identity_attack\":0.0, \"sexual_explicit\":0.0 } ```"}]}, "contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "That's what they are fighting for.
