The ownership is in flux. The stadium naming rights frankly should have been resolved before Elway's contract status.  (My humble naming suggestion: leave it as Mile High Stadium. A Broncos single game ticket is already the 2nd most expensive in the NFL according to Bleacher Report, so how much more $ is required for \"maintenance\"?)  I think Elway wants an ownership stake and the Bowlens are understandably reluctant to part with even 5%.  If Elway goes, he goes.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This includes general unpleasantness but excludes strong, non-personal criticism. - **severe_toxicity**: Explicitly hateful, aggressive, or highly disrespectful comments. This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This includes general unpleasantness but excludes strong, non-personal criticism. - **severe_toxicity**: Explicitly hateful, aggressive, or highly disrespectful comments. This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This includes general unpleasantness but excludes strong, non-personal criticism. - **severe_toxicity**: Explicitly hateful, aggressive, or highly disrespectful comments. This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.

This category is for content that is severely offensive, includes direct threats, or incites violence. - **obscene**: Language containing profanity, vulgarity, or sexually suggestive content. - **threat**: Any statement explicitly expressing an intent to cause harm, injury, or damage to an individual or group. - **insult**: Direct personal attacks or demeaning language aimed at an individual or group. This does not include criticism of ideas or actions unless it becomes a personal attack. - **identity_attack**: Discriminatory or hateful language targeting an individual or group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation). - **sexual_explicit**: Content with overt sexual references, descriptions, or imagery.
