"What is disrespectful about consensual sex?

Why would any decent, self-respecting conservative vote for a man who claimed that he could - well, I don't think I need to post that here.  He is the same person, you know.  Frankly, I think he's still in show biz.

Do you think he made a claim about an action that he didn't actually perform?

If he did what he said he could do ""any time he wanted"" he is a man who treats women like property.

If he didn't, he's a liar who said he did something that he didn't do.

Bill Clinton, at worst, cheated on his wife, something that we're all pretty sure Hillary had at least a smidgen of awareness about. He said that he didn't do something that he did do.

And earlier above, you said that everyone is still in denial ... your arguments are so narrowly focused, much like Donkels, that you have to be deliberately denying everything contrary.  Go through my comments and you will see someone who is searching for the underlying truth of the matter, because as I read others comments, I modify my positions from in-taking new information.  Most other honest commenters do the same as I.  As for you being so proud for posting under your own name, many of us don't have friends in high places to protect us from retaliation from our postings.  Many of us can lose our lively-hood simply for expressing an opinion.  You must be well placed in life.

The fact that no one chose to fly from there did not change the agreement. It stands and if commercial flights were banned those millions would be taken away too.

If you've been watching these meetings over the years and providing input, it always results in more closures to recreational access on BLM land all juxtaposed with the State still not getting it's rightful share of land as dictated by Statehood.  In order, it's the Feds, the Native Corps, and finally the State which is just not right.  Furthermore, please explain why in the Lower 48 most Forest Service Roads are accessible via motorized transportation while up here it's the complete opposite (gates at every trail-head)-why the double standard?  No, this is more of the same old mission creep which ends up with enforcement overreach by bored bureaucrats as exemplified by the 40-Mile River case.

Are they hoping for a confrontation that will play in their favor on the media? 
Maybe Trump will stay over and grab a Ritta's Burrito at the Saturday Market.

Text: ""The center of the ultra-liberal universe"". At least we're the center of something. I wonder if Trump has an motive for choosing Eugene to hold a rally. His people have to know this is a hotbed of activism. Do they think they are going to change a lot of Clinton or even Sanders supporters to join Trump? Are they hoping for a confrontation that will play in their favor on the media? 
Maybe Trump will stay over and grab a Ritta's Burrito at the Saturday Market.
