Do you think he made a claim about an action that he didn't actually perform?

If he did what he said he could do ""any time he wanted"" he is a man who treats women like property.

If he didn't, he's a liar who said he did something that he didn't do.

"Thank you Mr Burbank for another in the sequel of ""Why We Must Raise Taxes"" productions that you so admirably support.  In fact, to accomplish increases in revenue, raising taxes or finding new ways to tax are regressive solutions resulting in revenue reductions.  Both, by raising taxes and increasing in the number of taxes, you will slow down the economy, thereby decreasing the flow of taxed resources (money) resulting in reduced tax revenue.  And please, quit using the Educational System as the purported need for increased revenue as there are many ways to balance the budget for Public Education expenditures concurrent with ways to balance the overall budget without increasing taxes or increasing the number of ways to tax.

"I guess you really didn't do your research well enough....the reason  Palestinians didn't even exist when you were growing up is because at that time only Jews were called Palestinians the Arabs simply hijacked that name in 1967 before then none of them called themselves Palestinians....in fact the Arabs already have a country carved out of the BM Palestine it's called Jordan which together with Gaza already ( which puts over 80% of the original land into the hands of Arabs ) .....and Jordanian is what majority of those Arabs called themselves when Jordan illegally occupied  West Bank up to 1967,,....If Palestinas indeed had some unique identity why did they not try to establish a Palestinian nation under Jordanian rule or even ever mentioned it?

And when you talk about displaced people you have to remember that Arabs totally ethnically cleansed  their countries of Jews, nearly a million of them, when Israel was created. While in Israel today nearly 2 million Arabs live as citizen","```json

"There's a lot to be said for your first section.

You're wrong, however, in your second section. Many, many physicians were over-prescribing fentanyl patches--too high does, too many at a time, for too long a period, for symptoms for which an opioid was not going to be particularly helpful--and certainly not for long.

When physicians' primary source of information on pharmaceuticals is pharma reps, rather than professional journals (and there is much research to support that that's the case), this is what happens.

Particularly when the physicians have no education, training, or experience directly applicable to appropriate prescribing of opioids.

Oh--and more injection sites are a critical need--keeps people alive until their primary health problem can be properly and helpfully addressed.","```json

First thing, require every day in court to start at 8 am, not 10 am. One half hour lunches (one hour maximum), not two hours for lunch, and finish the day at 5 pm, not 3 pm. This is not an exaggeration. It's time the judges and prosecutors started working for their money. This would double the amount of time available in court, probably resulting in an immediate 70% increase in results, with the same amount of resources.

Second, require judges and prosecutors to sit through the summer like most working people. Three or four weeks holiday maximum. If you don't want to work fulltime, then we'll replace you with people who want to provide a full day's work.

Third, shed the stupid 18th century gowns and ancient technology and procedures. Start using modern technology to its fullest. No need to eliminate fundamental legal tenets.

"By the way large investment, low per-customer income means that, even if ISPs had gone there without government incentives - they would STILL have been a monopoly.
Because a large investment and low sales margine is the definition of a natural monopoly. It is NEVER worth it for a competitor to appear when those conditions hold - because the other company always has the advantage of having made part of their investment back already. Such cases the market can ONLY EVER be a monopoly.

So making it a government monopoly actually reduces the harm of the monopoly - because that means you can at least make some rules to limit how much it would be abused.

"No, Stephen. God's church is never satisfied with the status quo. It's just that the church seeks to change the status quo through Kingdom living, not political advocacy.  Christians who believe that the policies of Barack Obama or Donald Trump are God's method for changing the status quo distort God's plan and character. 

Jesus changed the status quo by a life that led to death on a cross. When the disciples of John the Baptist came to inquire why He seemed uninterested in fulfilling His inaugural promise to change the status quo, Jesus responded with  displays of personal love and mercy toward the victims of sin - not strident protests to Caesar, and demands that Caesar reform the laws that perpetuated the social, institutional and cultural status quo. 

The Jewish leaders expected the Messiah to change the status quo and achieve justice for the Jewish people. They would resonate with today's Christian social justice warriors.","```json

My opinion is that the definition of discrimination is not up for debate. You want to debate whether a fact is correct, it is silly.

Again, it is great what you think a business can and can not do, discriminate or not. That does not mean the law agrees with you.

"To quote Justin: ""We need a system that is fair for everyone,"" Mr. Trudeau replied. ""The current system encourages wealthy families to actually use private corporations to pay a lower tax rate than middle-class Canadians. That is not fair.""

This from a man who uses similar, different in name only, family trusts to avoid paying income tax.

This from a man whose cancellation of family tax credits implemented by the previous Conservative government (by their ending of income splitting for couples with children, eliminating the childrenâ€™s fitness tax credit, the education tax credit, the textbook tax credit, and even the tax credit for the working class who take public transit) has increased their middle-class taxes by an average of $840.00 per year according to a recent in-depth study.

How can we trust the Liberals?

Would you by a used car, or even a new car, from this man?

Must we count our fingers after shaking hands with Justin Trudeau?

Canadians can see that Trump is crashing into the greatest disaster of American politics ever.  That's why our media is like it is. And it isn't just Canada. It's the media around the world and across the U.S.A. (Hawaii and Alaska included). There is an orgasm of utter contempt going on and it will be spilling over until Trump goes away (health problems I hope). The Republican Party is ruining itself after such a wonderful victory three months ago. And America's youth today (5-18 years old) will despise the man and his party through their voting lives. Unprecedented.,"```json

William check your facts. This is a military owned field. It was authorized by the military for commercial and general aviation when they chose not to occupy it nearly 50yrs ago. The millions of dollars per year that is granted for upkeep by the federal govt. was stipulated on the agreement commercial airlines would be allowed to fly out of Paine Field. The fact that no one chose to fly from there did not change the agreement. It stands and if commercial flights were banned those millions would be taken away too. It seems you think your peace of mind should come before a healthy economic growth that would benefit thousands of people but that is not how growth stimulus works.

"I was actually more referencing what has been done in Laffer's name rather than what he actually said. His actual theory (which I understand) remains untested. Hardly any country has ever actually been at the peak of the Laffer curve but even if one had been - none has ever actually done what he actually proposed. Cutting taxes was NOT what Laffer proposed. Cutting taxes only on the rich was REALLY not what he proposed.
Laffer proposed a tax cut for EVERYBODY with short term spending cuts that match the tax cuts. Cutting on only the rich does NOT stimulate economic growth at all - they are already rich, you get MORE done by cutting on the middle class and poor and possibly enabling some wannabe entrepeneurs to afford to start a business.  
Not cutting spending means the whole plan falls appart.
Making the cuts permanent destroys it all - because it's harms outweigh any gains you can make. The cuts MUST be written in law to be temporary - ONLY until revenues recover.","```json

"Sorry Carl - this last election put this country under a Public PET Scanner and we discovered that the true malignant tumors in our beloved USA are you ""journalists"", and your fellow slime-bag minions in the Democrat Party.   Your kind have taken political ""discourse"" to a very new low, as you whine, kick, and scream like 4 year-olds who got their candy taken away.   Finally we have a president who can dish it back, and you hypocrites - who make it a business (not a hobby) destroying good, honest people, as well as our country's founding history and it's future with your re-writes, lies, and agenda you could never truly run for election on -  can't take it.     Keep screaming, and resisting  it makes you easier to find, target, and ultimately defeat.

These politicians only want to get their hands on the Halawa property to turn over to real estate developers.  Somewhere along the way, pockets will be lined.  UH football is simply the wedge to pry open the opportunity.  So I say, just give UH its own stadium and go develop Halawa as a commercial  complex that is really intended to capitalize on the tourist synergy that awaits between Halawa and Pearl Harbor.  The rail, as it really is intended, can route tourists from Waikiki/Ala Moana to Halawa/Pearl Harbor and eventually to Ko'Olina.","```json

What a bizarre misconception. Only some form of socialism re-distributes wealth, people. Yes, yes, rich people invest and create jobs, but ultimately, remember how, under Reagan, trickle-down economics failed miserably and the tax breaks for the wealthy only helped create today's super rich?

It was dedicated to Christ the Teacher- appropriate to our teaching order.  It featured the unheard of in DC at the time -the altar facing the people with benches radiating out from it.  The gilded icon image of Christ the Teacher was cut into the beige brick wall  and visible from all sight lines.  There were anxious months for the Brothers before this design was presented to Cardinal O'Boyle,  Fortunately, he was an alum of a FSC run college and subsequently made an Affiliated member of our Institute.  The Brothers rep at CUA over the years - both  faculty and students was stellar.  These factors figured into his approval.  
Other altars facing the people soon followed in the years following.  The College closed and went through several transformations - dooming Bob's Chapel .","```json

"What Libby Unthank Tower advocates for is crucial, not least in light of what's happened to the rock 'n' roll bar scene in Eugene that produced the likes of the Searchin' Soul Blues Band in the late '60s and the Robert Cray Band and Curtis Salgado in the 1970s and how, according to Martin Scorsese, ""Cinema is gone"" (Register-Guard, 12/27, C4), for just two immediate examples. But it's also important to make explicit what Unthank Tower implies. For ""culture"" is not only music, books and our heritage. It is those patterns of meaning any group or society uses to interpret and evaluate itself and its situation. It is the symbolic and learned aspects of society transmitted not biologically but via social interaction. Nor can culture be reduced to, or explained away by, economic and political factor, though of course those factors certainly do influence -- without determining -- culture for good and ill, as Unthank Tower and the plight of rock 'n' roll and cinema demonstrate vividly.","```json

His people have to know this is a hotbed of activism. Do they think they are going to change a lot of Clinton or even Sanders supporters to join Trump? Are they hoping for a confrontation that will play in their favor on the media? 
Maybe Trump will stay over and grab a Ritta's Burrito at the Saturday Market.
